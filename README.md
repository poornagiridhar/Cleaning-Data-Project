# Cleaning-Data-Project

This repository contains "run_analysis.R" which can be run in R 
as long as the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder is present in the working directory

It creates a tidy data set with all parameters averaged for each subject for each activity
This dataset is stored in "tidy_dataset.txt"

The "CodeBook.md" file has a list of variables and functions performed in the script to
change the raw data to the tidy data
It also has details about the source of the data and a link to the data itself
